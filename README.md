  <h1>Hivebreaker</h1>

  <p>
    This game was developed as a student project in 10 weeks at the <a href="https://www.school4games.net">School For Games</a> in Berlin! <br />
    Developement of this game was very troubled, and we faced a lot of problems.<br /> <br />

  Very close work with our VFX artist, SFX and music designer (all the same <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sacha-silva-art/">guy</a>!)<br />

  <h2>Example scripts</h2>
  Developement faced a lot of problems, there are still some scripts I'd like to show:<br /><br />
  <ul>
    Crossfading audio (depending on situation and rng)
    <li><a href="https://github.com/LumiToad/Hivebreaker/blob/main/Assets/Script/Audio/MusicPlayer.cs">MusicPlayer.cs</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/LumiToad/Hivebreaker/blob/main/Assets/Script/Game/GameMusicEvent.cs">GameMusicEvent.cs</a></li>
    Seamless player join (Co-Op)
    <li><a href="https://github.com/LumiToad/Hivebreaker/blob/main/Assets/Script/Game/GamePadHandler.cs">GamePadHandler.cs</a></li>
    Saving and loading files
    <li><a href="https://github.com/LumiToad/Hivebreaker/blob/main/Assets/Script/Game/SaveFileManager.cs">SaveFileManager.cs</a></li>
    Item interaction
    <li><a href="https://github.com/LumiToad/Hivebreaker/blob/main/Assets/Script/Interactable.cs">Interactable.cs</a></li>
  </ul>

  This was my first time working with Unity and C#.<br />
  I learned a lot of things, nowadays I would do a lot of stuff another way.
